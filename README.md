CMSC737 - Assembly Model Testing
================

Goal
----------------
Design software to determine whether an assembly invalidates a set of constraints.

Motivation
----------------
The genome sequence of an organism is a vital resource for biologists trying to better understand its function and evolution. Generating this sequence is not an easy task as modern sequencing technologies can only “read” small pieces of the genome. These sequences, known as reads, have to be pieced together by tools called assemblers using a collection of different heuristics since in almost all practical cases, **assemblers** cannot fully and accurately reconstruct the genome.
