- Potentially understand what the SAM file format contains. There exists a link to the PDF
tutorial on Chris' Github README.

- PySAM is a library which facilitates parsing of SAM files. We are currently in the process of
determining what the interoperability between .bam and .sam files are, and how one can create a .bam
file from a .sam file. .bam files are supposed to be a binary equivalent to .sam files which makes parsing
faster, and the PySAM library tutorial works on .bam files, however bowtie2 gives us .sam files.
If we determine how to generate a .bam file from a .sam file, we have a way to use that library
and its methods for understanding the SAM file format.

- Until Thursday: Jason will study the SAM PDF to try to see what it all means. Michael is trying
to install PySAM on his computer.
