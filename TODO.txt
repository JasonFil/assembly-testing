- Florin needs to debug his SAM parsing class to cater for the case where coverage over a window
larger than 1bp is requested.

- Jason and Kostas will use Florin's class (assumed error-free) to implement the sliding window approach.
Briefly:

	(*) Elementary parsing of the assembly FASTA file (parse every contig, storing its length).
	(*) Make sure that the window length requested of Florin's class is always a fraction of 
		the contig's length.
	(*) Two-pass approach: Go over the entire assembly once and calculate the average coverage over the
		appropriate window size. That's the first pass. The second pass will flag regions as being
		above or below an appropriate percentile and output those.

- Michael also mentioned that for Tuesday we can generate a bunch of random correctness tests to prove that our
system works with various inputs. Atif mentioned that he wants, quote, 4 use cases, unquote, but that's more relevant
to the other groups, not others. Our group would seem another analogous, and we are also waiting on Chris' input for
what this analysis might be.

- Potential meetup on both Monday and Tuesday (Tuesday one hour prior to the presentation).
